Hi, I’m Tina! A third-year Data Science major at UC San Diego, with a minor in Economics. I didn’t start out in data science. In fact, I entered college with no coding experience, but after taking my first data science course, I was fascinated by how data science is shaping the world today, powering decision-making, optimizing user experiences, and driving innovation across industries. I was especially drawn to how raw data can be transformed into meaningful, actionable insights that influence real-world outcomes. Since then, I’ve systematically built my expertise in [data science courses](#education) and worked on various [projects](/projects/).

Beyond technical skills, my economics background strengthens my approach to data-driven decision-making. Studying topics like econometrics and market analysis has taught me how to extract patterns from data, optimize decisions, and understand broader system behaviors. Whether it’s forecasting trends, improving business strategies, or uncovering insights, I enjoy tackling real-world problems with data.

I’m currently seeking my first data science internship. I’m eager to apply my problem-solving mindset and technical expertise in a professional setting, learning from experienced mentors, contributing to impactful projects and improving myself. I’m a fast learner, a dedicated problem solver, and someone who thrives in a data-driven environment. If you’re looking for a motivated and analytical mind to join your team, I’d love to connect!
